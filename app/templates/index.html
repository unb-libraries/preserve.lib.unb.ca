<h1>UNB Libraries Project Preservation</h1>

<p>For nearly two decades, UNB Libraries has partnered with researchers at UNB and beyond to develop innovative projects in digital scholarship. Although not intended as a permanent archive, this space provides access to selected projects that were developed at UNB Libraries but are no longer being actively updated or maintained.</p>
<p>Each project has been captured as a dated 'snapshot', after which no further changes have been made. While every effort has been made to preserve access to content, not all functionality is preserved: external links, forms, and search may not work as expected.</p>
<p>Questions or comments on individual projects can be addressed to the project contact. For more information about project preservation, please <a href="//lib.unb.ca/libmail/contactform.php?email=jmackenz&subject=Preservation%20Projects">contact James MacKenzie</a> (Director of Scholarly Technologies).</p>

	<dd><strong>Web archive date:</strong> August 17, 2018</dd>
	<dd>
		<p>UNB Libraries released two versions of its mobile website over 3 years. The first version, not captured in this archive, launched in July of 2010.</p>
		<p>A second more robust version (represented here), with authentication and customizable features such as a default library, hours and contacts, catalogue searching, tracking for borrowed items and fines and personalized Course Reserves was released in May 2011. The mobile site ran in parallel to main UNB Libraries website.</p>
		<p>In the spring of 2013, with responsive websites supplanting the need for a mobile-specific site, the decision was made to decommission m.lib.unb.ca.</p>

In 2016 (Issue 35), QWERTY moved to an online-only publication format: for current issues, visit <a href="https://www.qwertyunb.com/">https://www.qwertyunb.com/</a></dd>

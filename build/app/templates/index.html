<h1>UNB Libraries Project Preservation</h1>

<p>For nearly two decades, UNB Libraries has partnered with researchers at UNB and beyond to develop innovative projects in digital scholarship. Although not intended as a permanent archive, this space provides access to selected projects that were developed at UNB Libraries but are no longer being actively updated or maintained.</p>
<p>Each project has been captured as a dated 'snapshot', after which no further changes have been made. While every effort has been made to preserve access to content, not all functionality is preserved: external links, forms, and search may not work as expected.</p>
<p>Questions or comments on individual projects can be addressed to the project contact. For more information about project preservation, please <a href="//lib.unb.ca/contact-unb-libraries-staff?recipient=jmackenz&subject=Preservation%20Projects">contact James MacKenzie</a> (Director of Scholarly Technologies).</p>

	<dd>The ArtCan research project and portal concluded its work in March of 2017, and ArtCan.ca remained live until September 2022. ArtCan’s goal was to facilitate the exchange of research expertise, knowledge creation, training, and practice in the visual arts in Canada. Projects undertaken by ArtCan’s partners and collaborators were designed for specialist and non-specialist audiences, whether local, regional, or transnational. ArtCan.ca features digital galleries of works from UNB’s Art Centre and the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, as well as links to research and other resources for the study of Canadian art and its history.</dd>

		<p>UNB Libraries released two versions of its mobile website over 3 years. The first version, not captured in this archive, launched in July of 2010.</p>
		<p>A second more robust version (represented here), with authentication and customizable features such as a default library, hours and contacts, catalogue searching, tracking for borrowed items and fines and personalized Course Reserves was released in May 2011. The mobile site ran in parallel to main UNB Libraries website.</p>
		<p>In the spring of 2013, with responsive websites supplanting the need for a mobile-specific site, the decision was made to decommission m.lib.unb.ca.</p>

	<dd><strong>Web archive date:</strong> November 27, 2023</dd>
	<dd>
		<p>The Ward Chipman Brief is a restored, 43 page manuscript with handwriting on both sides of each page. In 1800, Ward Chipman and Samuel Denny Street defended the right of a Slave woman, Nancy, to obtain her freedom. There was no existing legislation in New Brunswick on slavery and Chipman and Street offered their services pro bono in an attempt to establish a precedent. Although the two young Fredericton lawyers were not successful in their bid to free Nancy from her owner, Caleb Jones; their efforts are considered seminal in directing the course of New Brunswick law.</p>

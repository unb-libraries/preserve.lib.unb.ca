<h1>UNB Libraries Project Preservation</h1>

<p>For nearly two decades, UNB Libraries has partnered with researchers at UNB and beyond to develop innovative projects in digital scholarship. Although not intended as a permanent archive, this space provides access to selected projects that were developed at UNB Libraries but are no longer being actively updated or maintained.</p>
<p>Each project has been captured as a dated 'snapshot', after which no further changes have been made. While every effort has been made to preserve access to content, not all functionality is preserved: external links, forms, and search may not work as expected.</p>
<p>Questions or comments on individual projects can be addressed to the project contact. For more information about project preservation, please <a href="//lib.unb.ca/contact-unb-libraries-staff?recipient=jmackenz&subject=Preservation%20Projects">contact James MacKenzie</a> (Director of Scholarly Technologies).</p>

	<dd>The ArtCan research project and portal concluded its work in March of 2017, and ArtCan.ca remained live until September 2022. ArtCan’s goal was to facilitate the exchange of research expertise, knowledge creation, training, and practice in the visual arts in Canada. Projects undertaken by ArtCan’s partners and collaborators were designed for specialist and non-specialist audiences, whether local, regional, or transnational. ArtCan.ca features digital galleries of works from UNB’s Art Centre and the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, as well as links to research and other resources for the study of Canadian art and its history.</dd>

	<dd><strong>Web archive date:</strong> Nov. 27, 2023</dd>
	<dd>The Benjamin Marston Diary Project was designed in the late 1990's as a prototype in the creation of the University of New Brunswick Electronic Text Centre (ETC). A major goal of the project was learning Standard Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, in electronic publishing. The Marston Diaries were chosen as a pilot project for various reasons. The diaries were of significant local and regional historical interest, with Marston's experiences being in many ways those of the archetypal Loyalist who came to this region. Benjamin Marston's diary spans three volumes and is located within the Winslow Papers at UNB Archives and Special Collections, volumes 20, 21 and 22. The diary begins in 1776, volume 22, for 36 pages. It then continues in volume 20 (1778-1780).</dd>

	<dd>This collection [assembled in the late 1990's] brings together the images of 57 commission reports conducted between 1784 and 1950. Because no single institution in New Brunswick has a complete set of all the reports of these commissions, these were copied from the holdings of the collections of the Legislative Library, the University of New Brunswick Libraries, and the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick. These three institutions have additional information in both original and published for among their rich holdings on in the history of the province.</dd>

	<dd>The New Brunswick School Book database, originally created in 2004, is no longer fully accessible but can still be browsed by curriculum subject. The subjects include both English and French listings. Since subject terminology and content change over time, decisions on assigning subject areas were necessarily arbitrary, but every effort was made to define the subject area and to ensure consistency. Researchers should carefully check the definitions of curriculum subjects and check related subjects with areas of overlap. <a href="https://lib.unb.ca/archives/book-collections/new-brunswick-school-book-collection">Much of the physical collection is now searchable through UNB WorldCat.</a></dd>

	<dd><strong>Web archive date:</strong> Feb. 26, 2024</dd>
	<dd>
		<p>This collection, originally created in 2000, is comprised of about 500 photographs depicting the history of varsity sports, recreation and physical education programs at UNB from 1884-1993.  Photographs pre-1900 document "Sports Day", the earliest version of organized sporting activities at UNB, and the beginnings of the UNB 'football' (English style rugby) team which grew to national stature in the 1920s. Official team photographs predominate with numerous images of basketball, hockey, and swim teams. As well, photographs of less prominent sports such as soccer, track and field, boxing and gymnastics are available. Portraits from awards banquets, candid shots of players and games, and views of athletic facilities are included in the collection. Women's, men's and co-ed teams at the varsity, junior varsity and recreational levels are represented.</p>
		<p>In 2024, team and composite sports photos from this database were migrated into <a href="https://composites.lib.unb.ca/">UNB Class Composite & Group Photographs</a>.</p>

	<dd>
		<p>The Ward Chipman Brief is a restored, 43 page manuscript with handwriting on both sides of each page. In 1800, Ward Chipman and Samuel Denny Street defended the right of a Slave woman, Nancy, to obtain her freedom. There was no existing legislation in New Brunswick on slavery and Chipman and Street offered their services pro bono in an attempt to establish a precedent. Although the two young Fredericton lawyers were not successful in their bid to free Nancy from her owner, Caleb Jones; their efforts are considered seminal in directing the course of New Brunswick law.</p>
